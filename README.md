## Games
### Word Search

#### Easy
This is the most basic version of the wordSearch. It consists of a 10x10 grid 
and 10 words. Each word it has a maximum length of 5 characters. Words are 
horizontal or vertical in reading order.

##### Medium
For those wanting a more difficult challenge! This difficulty consists of a 
14x14 grid with 12 words to find. Each word can be 7 characters in length.
Another catch is that words can be reversed! You might be searching 
left-to-right, but you might just want to start from behind.

##### Hard
This mode requires the player to find 14 words in a 16x16 grid.
Adding words doesn't add too much complexity, you might think.
However, another addition here is the introduction of diagonals.

#### Expert
For those who fear God and God alone.
This 20x20 grid challenges the user with 16 words to hunt
each with a potential maximum length of 15 characters.
This mode also extends on the hard difficulty by adding reverse diagonals.
